## Spotify Predictions Project
### Using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arthurboari/lana-del-rey-spotify-data) Kaggle dataset, the project aims to predict the energy level of Lana Del Rey's songs using various machine learning models. The project involves analyzing musical elements such as acousticness, valence, and tempo to evaluate the accuracy of predictive models. By leveraging these features, the project provides insights into the factors that contribute to the energy level of the artist's music. The models tested in this project include Ridge and Plynomial Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Boosted Tree, and Pruned Decision Tree, The final project can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allison02kim/Lana-Del-Rey-Spotify/master/Final.html) and the code [here](https://github.com/allison02kim/Lana-Del-Rey-Spotify.git)
