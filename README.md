## Spotify Predictions Project
### The final project can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allison02kim/Lana-Del-Rey-Spotify/master/Final.html) and the code [here](https://github.com/allison02kim/Lana-Del-Rey-Spotify.git)

#### Using [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arthurboari/lana-del-rey-spotify-data) Kaggle dataset, the project aims to predict the energy level of Lana Del Rey's songs using various machine learning models. The project involves analyzing musical elements such as acousticness, valence, tempo, etc. as predictive variables in the evaluation of different models. This project invoved Data cleaning in R, exploratory data analysis, model testing on six different machine learning models, and analysis of results using various metrics. The models tested in this project include Ridge and Plynomial Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Boosted Tree, and Pruned Decision Tree. 

## Election Report
### The final report is found [here](https://github.com/allison02kim/Election-Report/blob/afaeb0559f38ea8a17a322f9094f09e91c0c2811/report.pdf) and the code [here](https://github.com/allison02kim/Election-Report.git)

#### In this project I collaborated with a small team and utilized PySpark to handle big data (voter files data from 2020) and extract insights. My team and I Conducted EDA, employed Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest to analyze the impact of socio-demographic factors on voter participation and election party predictions. We investigated ROC AUC analysis, revealing insights into model performance and limitations, Highlighting the complexity of voter behavior and the interplay between socio-demographic factors.
